# 👋 Welcome

I'm learning Java, Spring Boot, and Linux system administration, focusing on practical applications with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Always Free tier and RHEL 10 in a dual-boot setup. My work includes setting up RHEL images on OCI and testing Java connections to OCI APIs.

💡 **Interests**: Backend development, REST APIs, cloud integration, and Linux sysadmin tasks.

🌱 **Goal**: Progress from Java fundamentals to professional Spring Boot applications, while mastering RHEL and OCI deployments.

## 📚 Courses in Progress

- **Java Programming for Beginners (Udemy)**: Learned core concepts like variables, loops, and classes; built simple console applications to practice.
- **Java Masterclass – Become a Java Developer (Udemy)**: Explored object-oriented programming and Maven; created small projects to test concepts.
- **Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 & Hibernate for Beginners (Udemy)**: Started with basic Spring Boot apps, focusing on dependency injection and REST endpoints.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

`Java` `Spring Boot` `Maven` `React` `Angular` `PostgreSQL` `Podman` `RHEL 10 Linux`

I've used Maven for Java project builds, RHEL 10 for local development, and OCI for cloud deployments.

## 📂 Project Overview

My repositories document hands-on learning:
- [code](https://github.com/tfeydev/code): Guides for RHEL image deployment on OCI and a structure for Linux/Bash/Podman experiments.
- [ConnectionTestOciJavaSdk](https://github.com/tfeydev/ConnectionTestOciJavaSdk): A Java project to test OCI SDK connections using Maven.
