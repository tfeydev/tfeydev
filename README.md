# 👋 Welcome to my Development Space

I'm focused on high-performance backend development and systems programming, specializing in **Rust** and **Julia** for data-intensive and algorithmic tasks. My current goal is to migrate parts of my existing Java/Spring Boot backend logic to Rust to leverage its performance and memory safety.

💡 **Current Focus**: Mastering Rust (using "the book") and Julia (using CLRS and "Algorithms with Julia") to build fast, robust backend services. I also pursue frontend development with **React/Vite** and **Tailwind CSS v4+**.

🌱 **Goal**: Transition from traditional Java/Spring Boot setups to a modern, high-performance stack utilizing Rust and Julia for compute-heavy workloads, while maintaining robust Linux system administration skills on Fedora and RHEL.

## 🛠️ Core Tech Stack & Projects

| Category | Technologies | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend & Performance** | `Rust` `Julia` `Spring Boot` `Java` | Migrating services and developing high-performance algorithms (CLRS implementation). |
| **Frontend** | `React` `Vite` `Tailwind CSS v4+` | Learning and implementing modern, component-based UIs. |
| **System & Cloud** | `Fedora Linux` `RHEL 10 Linux` `Podman` `OCI` | Local development, system administration, and cloud deployments. |
| **Databases** | `PostgreSQL` `Apache AGE` | Standard data persistence layer. |

## 📂 Project Overview

My repositories document hands-on learning and migration efforts:
- [leetcode](https://github.com/tfeydev/leetcode): Contains my well-documented Rust solutions for algorithmic problems (like Two Sum), following best practices for module and test structure.
- [clrs](https://github.com/tfeydev/clrs): Implementing algorithms and data structures from *Introduction to Algorithms* (CLRS) in Rust and Julia.
- [todo_api](https://github.com/tfeydev/todo_api): Demonstrates my initial backend work, currently being analyzed for potential migration to Rust.
- [ConnectionTestOciJavaSdk](https://github.com/tfeydev/ConnectionTestOciJavaSdk): Legacy Java project testing OCI SDK connectivity, marking my starting point for migration studies.
