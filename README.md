# 🚀 IT Professional → Backend Engineer (Java / Spring Boot)

**Current Role:** IT Support Specialist  
**Focus:** Java Backend Engineering with Spring Boot  
**What I do:** Design, build, and deploy production-ready backend systems while transitioning into a full-time backend role.

This repository space showcases **real-world backend projects**, cloud deployments, and infrastructure — not just tutorials.

---

## 🎯 Backend Focus: Spring Boot & Cloud-Native APIs

Building and operating RESTful backend services with:

- Java & Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL & JPA/Hibernate
- Clean Architecture & backend best practices
- Docker / Podman containerization
- CI/CD pipelines and cloud deployments

I focus on **hands-on implementation**, real deployments, and maintainable system design.

## 💡 Why Everything Is Public

I believe in **learning and building in public**.

By sharing architecture decisions, implementations, and mistakes:
- I improve faster through feedback
- Others can learn from real examples
- My progress is transparent and verifiable
