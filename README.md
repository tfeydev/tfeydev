# 👋 Welcome

🎓 Currently learning Java and Spring Boot through Chad Darby's Udemy courses. I've completed initial modules on Java fundamentals, including variables, loops, and object-oriented programming, and am now applying these to build simple backend applications.

💡 Interests: Backend development, REST APIs, full-stack applications. I've explored how these integrate with cloud services like OCI for deployment.

🌱 Goal: Progress from Java fundamentals to building professional Spring Boot applications. So far, I've set up development environments with Maven and tested basic connections to cloud APIs.

## 📚 Courses in Progress

* Java Programming for Beginners (Udemy) - Focused on core syntax, data structures, and error handling; practiced with simple console apps.
* Java Masterclass – Become a Java Developer (Udemy) - Covered advanced topics like multithreading and file I/O; built small projects to test concepts.
* Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 & Hibernate for Beginners (Udemy) - Learning dependency injection, REST controllers, and database integration; configured initial Spring Boot apps locally.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

`Java` `Spring Boot` `Maven` `React` `Angular` `PostgreSQL` `Docker` `RHEL 10 Linux`

I've used these in practice: Set up Maven for project builds, Docker for containerization tests, and RHEL 10 for local development in a dual-boot environment.

## 📂 Project Overview

This repository serves as a central workspace linking to related projects, utilities, and documentation. It documents my learning progress in Java, OCI integration, and Linux sysadmin tasks. Key linked repos include:
- [code](https://github.com/tfeydev/code): Documentation for RHEL/OCI deployments and scripts.
- [ConnectionTestOciJavaSdk](https://github.com/tfeydev/ConnectionTestOciJavaSdk): A Maven-based Java project testing OCI SDK connections.
